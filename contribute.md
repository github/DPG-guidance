## Welcome!

We are excited that you are interested in doing some good with us and contributing to our project! 

Regardless if you contribute as a team or an individual we ask that you follow our [contributing guidelines.](https://github.com/rubyforgood/casa/blob/main/doc/CONTRIBUTING.md)


### Contribute as an Individual

Any issue that has the label [Help Wanted](https://github.com/rubyforgood/casa/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Help+Wanted%22) is available to be worked on. 


### Contribute as a Team

We welcome contributions from teams and we've broken up our larger chunks of needed work into two categories. The first is work where all the work is clearly defined and your team can jump in and immediately begin work. The second is work that needs to be done but will require meeting with the stakeholders -- you'll have to opportunity meet and interact with the people you'll be helping! If interesting in contributing as a team please reach out one of the project leads to coordinate your participation!

#### Queued up work:

Our application currently communicates with the advocates of the foster children through e-mail. We'd like to add in text messaging into the application in order to facilitate communication and to ensure messages are not missed. [View the tasks in this epic.](https://github.com/rubyforgood/casa/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%3Aiphone%3A+SMS%22) 

When our foster children advocates accompany their assigned youths to their court appointments they are required to give reports to the court officials. [The various reports are outlined in this epic.](https://github.com/rubyforgood/casa/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%3Awoman_judge%3A+Court+Reports+%26+Details%22+)

#### Discovery is needed:

Reimbursement reports. Several CASAs throughout the country reimburse their volunteers for their travel (milage) to and from time spent with their assigned foster youth. We need to fully understand how these reports are used, what and how the requirements may differ by state, and then implement it in the application.
