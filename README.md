## Guidance for DPG's

We've created a helpful [checklist](https://github.com/github/DPG-guidance/blob/main/checklist.md) full of suggestions to ensure your Digital Public Good is in a good place for contributors.

### Resources for your DPG

We know that as a social sector organization, finding ways to stretch your budget is always a top priority. That's why we've compiled a list of tech companies that donate their services or products to nonprofits. This is known as in-kind giving, and it can be a great way for your organization to access the resources it needs without having to spend money. The tech companies on our list donate a wide range of products and services, including software, hardware, cloud computing services, and professional services such as training and consulting. By taking advantage of these in-kind donations, you can save your organization money and redirect those resources towards other important areas. We hope this list is helpful in your search for cost-saving solutions.
